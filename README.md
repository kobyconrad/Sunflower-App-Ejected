# Sunflower-App

Sunflower is a toolkit for those trying to stay sober, helping you track how long it has been, and training your brain to associate sobriety with reward. The app is built around the core concept that it's not enough to simply "stop", but that you must learn new ways to seek reward, pleasure, and dopamine. 

It's a little silly, but earning a Sunflower for every day you stay sober, is a strong way to reinforce the rewards of sobriety.

It's not a "digital make believe Sunflower". 

It's a day sober. It's a dinner with your family. It's a paper you wrote for school. It's a new skill you improved. It's your body regaining its health. It's a step towards not just recovery, but to a better and improved life. 

One Sunflower at a time. 

The app comes with built in guided journaling exercises. If you follow them, they are designed to help you associate activities like exercise, being social, and learning, with reward. 

Learn to associate something like exercise with reward or pleasure, and watch as your cravings change from destructive to empowering.
